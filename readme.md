# User Journey

---

The user will be brought in to the sign in page, when the user has no account, they will be prompted to register.
Once the account is registered, a `INSERT` command is run on the `user` table, and a `TRIGGER` will be ran, to automatically create an instance in the `account` table.
The user can then login into the account.

The user will be brought in to the sign in `index.php` page, when the user has no account, they will be prompted to register at `signup.php`.

Once the account is registered, a `INSERT` command is run on the `user` table, and a `TRIGGER` will be ran, to automatically create an instance in the `account` table with 0 balance.
