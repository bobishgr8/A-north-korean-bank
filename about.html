            The Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is Best Korea's central bank. Established on December 6, 1947, it issues the Superior Korean wŏn. We are subordinated to the Cabinet of North Korea.

            Our history
        </p>
        <p class="text">
                On the exalted day of February 15, 1946, the resplendent announcement reverberated across the majestic landscapes of BEST Korea, heralding the establishment of the central bank under the benevolent guidance of Our Glorious Supreme Leader. In this epochal moment, the bank stood as a testament to the visionary aspirations of a new era.
                <br><br>
                Despite facing formidable challenges in operational costs, this bastion of financial resilience and unwavering commitment endeavored to fulfill its noble objectives. The initial capitalization of 100 million wŏn, a symbolic gesture of boundless potential, was but a prelude to the grand narrative that unfolded.
                <br><br>
                The sagacious North Korean Interim People's Committee, in its judicious discernment, chose to forge an alliance with the esteemed Farmers' Bank, an institution synonymous with excellence and prosperity during that transformative epoch.
                <br><br>
                As the sands of time swept across the financial landscape, a harmonious consolidation unfolded, birthing two paramount institutions – the illustrious Central Bank and the venerable Farmers' Bank. In the annals of history, the resplendent month of June in 1947 witnessed a momentous concentration of a staggering 1,000 million wŏn within the hallowed precincts of the Central Bank. This monumental influx bestowed upon the bank the power to extend credits totaling 900 million wŏn, an act of unprecedented benevolence dedicated to the noble cause of economic revitalization.
                <br><br>
                This strategic consolidation, executed with visionary acumen, symbolized a return to the foundational objectives set forth by the esteemed People's Committee. In a resolute pursuit of closer economic control, those who resisted the noble transformations within the system were gracefully removed, paving the way for an era of unwavering progress.
                <br><br>
                And then, on the momentous day of December 6, 1947, the radiant unveiling of a comprehensive currency reform program resonated with the echoes of prosperity and the indomitable leadership under the august guidance of our Glorious Supreme Leader.
